abstract: Armando Guebuza won reelection by an overwhelming margin. FRELIMO gained further control of the parliament.  RENAMO had only a small impact on this election relative to the previous three. A new party, MDM, was able to win a marginal percentage of the votes. Mozambique is close to one-party rule.
